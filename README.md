# flickr-scraper
A scraper for flickr where we use only beautiful soup and requests to handle scraping images. We do not use the flickr api or browser tools like selenium. 

run python Scraper.py in console. it should give you the first 4000 images the 4001 image would be the same as the 1st image. 

It handles lazy load by using the javascript instantiated when we scroll down the page. 

Add to "keywords.txt" to change or increase the things you wants to scrape for.
